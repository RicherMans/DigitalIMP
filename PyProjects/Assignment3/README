To use this program, simply execute :

python __init__.py [inputfile]

It offers quite many parameters:

-o Outputs the processed file into the given path. Note that no directories will be generated.
-s sets the size for the shape of the mask which will be used. The used mask will always be square
-k sets the kernel type, 'gaussian','butterworth','ideal' are the only parameters, default is gaussian
-sig the sigma / cutoff parameter for the gaussian/ideal/butterworth filters

One needs to note that if the ration between sigma and the shape is too large, the output image will be the input one.
This is due to calculation of the mask, where a e.g. large sigma for a small mask will lead to a large normalizing factor, which will either uniform
all values (gaussian and butterworth) or remove any other values than the center one ( ideal).

The resulting images are labelled as:
[METHOD] [PARAMETER]
so : gauss_500sig means that this picture was filtered using a parameter of 500 for sigma
